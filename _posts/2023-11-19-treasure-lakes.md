Here is a low quality picture of a campsite I stayed at on Treasure Lakes, near Bishop, CA in the summer of 2023. This trip was an adventure. We got rained out of Desolation Wilderness near Lake Tahoe. To escape the rain, we fled south to Bishop, and nabbed the last permit for a Treasure Lakes overnight. The lakes are nestled into a small basin. If you want to get higher up from here, you may have to traverse a snow field that runs near a small waterfall. Even in September we considered it too dangerous given our footwear. For a longer hike, heading towards Bishop Pass to Dusy Basin from the same trailhead would have been better.
