title: Engineering vs Science I
description: Applying to Grad School Makes Me Think About Engineering vs Science
---

I've been thinking recently about the inherent differences between the scientific and engineering mentalities, and found a book called [Definition of the Engineering Method](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED276572). 

This book argues that engineers are forced, by our design constraints, to rely on heuristics to solve problems, and that this reliance is what distinguishes us from scientists and mathematicians. There is also a larger philosophical difference. Science is fundamentally concerned with a search for truth that engineering, as a discipline, is indifferent towards. That is, scientists _assume_ that an absolute truth exists, and that with infinite resources, the truth can be fully known. Engineers design systems based on their own preferred techniques, and the succesful implementation of the system validates the usefulness of those techniques, in a given design process only. In other words, where a scientist values truth and correctness, an engineer values utility, and isn't as concerned with overarching principles. 

Personally, I don't have too much faith in absolute truths.

And here is a low quality picture of a campsite I stayed at on Treasure Lakes, near Bishop, CA.
